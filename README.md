# README

This is the frontend for the Century Checklist. The concept behind this app is being able to keep track of inventory on a digital platform. 

While I worked at Century Bakery, I was tasked to count inventory, which included ingredients, paper stock, and cleaning supplies. The bad part is that I had to keep track of everything using pencil and paper. This app is being created as a solution for Century Bakery to keep track of inventory while reducing waste and costs by eliminating the need to print paper forms every few days, reduce expenses (including paper and ink), and keeping simple, concise records of our inventory history.
